# Basic Hangman Game
This project implements a basic terminal based hangman game. One random word is chosen from the sample words and user's job is to find the word by guessing letters one by one.

Feel free to take a look at the code and play with it. Sample word list can be found at line 140 in *Hangman.java*.
